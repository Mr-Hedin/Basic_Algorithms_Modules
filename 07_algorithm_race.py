# We'll find a random target value to search that is within the range of the data_set we just generated.

# Below, we'll start calling our toolkit of functions to time them!

# To race the algorithms, we need to run them multiple times and take the average time to get a fair comparison.

# To time an algorithm we'll use time.time()... to get the time. time.time() returns the current time in seconds since the beginning of the program.

# We'll use the time.time() function to get the start time 
# run the algorithm
# then use the time.time() function again to get the end time of the algorithm.

# We'll then find the difference between the end time and start time to get the time it took to run the algorithm.



# Out of our algorithms, we'll time our linear search and binary search first. 
# Since these two algorithms are very similar, timing them is a good comparison.

# We'll also time our other algorithms to see how they perform.
# Let's time them using the same process.

# Side note: if we were thinking efficiently, we could have used the same process for all of our algorithms.
# We could have created a function that takes an algorithm as an argument in order to time it.
# This would have made our code more flexible and reusable, but functions as arguments are often trickier than they seem, so we'll save that for another day!
