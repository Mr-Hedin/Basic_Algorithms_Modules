# Basic_Algorithms_Modules

In this unit you will begin exploring simple ```algorithms``` which allow us to solve problems by breaking them into steps.

Key Terms:
1. Algorithm - A set of steps to solve a problem
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
6. ...
7. Will finish this when I get the chance!


Algorithms (and what they do):
1. Divisibility - Checks to see if two numbers are evenly divisible.
2. Sum - Adds up a *list* of numbers.
3. Min/Max - Find the biggest/smallest out of a list.
4. Linear Search - Finds a target in a list by searching item by item.
5. Binary Search - Finds a target in a *sorted* list by splitting the search area in half each step.

algorithms.py contains a toolkit of functions that can be imported for the final project or to test out functions we create in the lessons!
