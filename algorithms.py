# Algorithms File:
# This file contains a collection of algorithms that are commonly used in programming.
# These functions can be called in other files to perform various tasks.
# Think of it like a toolkit that you can build up over time.
# Many excellent programmers have built up their own toolkits of algorithms and data structures that they use in their projects.
# This is a structure to start building your own toolkit, eventually you could publish your own Python package to share with others!
